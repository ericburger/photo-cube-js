# PhotoCudeJS

PhotoCubeJS is a jQuery plugin for creating photo slideshows, cubes, and sliceboxes. The plugin implements 2D-3D projections and transformations in JavaScript and renders the images to an HTML5 Canvas (does not use CSS3 transforms). A number of customizable animations for photo transitions are included in the plugin. Live demos for the plugin can be found at [here][pcjsdemo].
